# Database (db) Module

This directory contains the database configuration and initialization files for our FastAPI application.

## Purpose

The db module manages database connections, sessions, and provides the base configuration for our SQLAlchemy models.

## Files

- `__init__.py`: Initializes the db package, making its contents easily importable.
- `base.py`: Defines the declarative base for SQLAlchemy models.
- `init_db.py`: Contains functions to initialize the database, create tables, and perform initial setup.
- `session.py`: Manages database sessions and provides a dependency for FastAPI routes.

## Usage

The files in this directory are used to:
1. Set up the database connection
2. Create and manage database sessions
3. Initialize the database schema
4. Provide base classes for SQLAlchemy models

## Key Components

- **Declarative Base**: Defined in `base.py`, used as the base class for all SQLAlchemy models.
- **Database URL**: Typically configured in an environment variable or config file, used in `session.py`.
- **SessionLocal**: A factory for creating database sessions, defined in `session.py`.
- **get_db**: A dependency function used in FastAPI routes to manage database sessions.

## Best Practices

1. Keep database credentials secure and out of version control.
2. Use environment variables for configuration when possible.
3. Ensure proper session management to prevent connection leaks.
4. Use async database operations if your application requires high concurrency.

## Dependencies

- SQLAlchemy
- Database driver (e.g., psycopg2-binary for PostgreSQL)
- Python-dotenv (for managing environment variables)

## Setup

1. Ensure all required dependencies are installed.
2. Set up your database URL in the appropriate environment variable or config file.
3. Run the initialization script (if any) to create tables and set up the initial database state.

## Maintenance

- Regularly check for and apply updates to SQLAlchemy and your database driver.
- Monitor database performance and optimize queries as needed.
- When making changes to the database schema, ensure to update both the models and any migration scripts.
