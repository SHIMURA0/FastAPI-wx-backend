# Models

This directory contains the database models for our FastAPI application.

## Purpose

The models in this directory define the structure of our database tables using SQLAlchemy ORM. They represent the data schema and provide an abstraction layer for interacting with the database.

## Files

- `__init__.py`: Initializes the models package and may contain imports to make models easily accessible.
- `instrument.py`: Defines the model for sequencing instruments and related data.
- `user.py`: Contains the user model for authentication and user management.

## Usage

These models are used in conjunction with SQLAlchemy to:
1. Create database tables
2. Perform database operations (CRUD)
3. Define relationships between different data entities

## Best Practices

1. Keep models simple and focused on data representation.
2. Use appropriate SQLAlchemy column types and constraints.
3. Include relevant metadata like `__tablename__` for each model.
4. Define clear relationships between models when necessary.
5. Use mixins for common fields or behaviors across multiple models.

## Dependencies

- SQLAlchemy
- Database driver (e.g., psycopg2 for PostgreSQL)

## Notes

- Ensure that any changes to models are reflected in database migrations.
- When adding new models, remember to import them in `__init__.py` if needed for easier access from other parts of the application.

## Maintenance

When updating models:
1. Create a new migration script using Alembic.
2. Test the migration in a safe environment before applying to production.
3. Update any related schemas in the `schemas` directory.
4. Adjust CRUD operations in the `crud` directory if necessary.

For any questions or issues related to these models, please contact the backend team lead.
